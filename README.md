# Projects' Cluster
Collection of projects in computational aerodynamics within ACE/FASTT.

Each collaborator SHOULD always work in his own branch where all his/her source and project files SHOULD always be stored. Restrictions on 'push' command are enforced to each specific branch.

Each branch is linked to a specific project on the tab 'Projects' where its history and development SHOULD be recorded in terms of list tasks to perform, tasks in progress, tasks completed and where any additional idea / further development on the same subject shoudl be indicated in the 'nice-to-have' column.
